# userstyles
Repo for some userstyles I've made. Install the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) extension in Chrome, Firefox, or Opera to use these themes.

* SemiconductorEngineering Dark
  * Required restyling and resizing multiple different pages and subpages
  * Removed unnecessary elements
* Weekplan Dark
  * Many dynamic elements restyled
  * Site was redesigned, mostly broken
* Anandtech Dark
* Nova Dark
  * Site was rebranded, however this was a significant restyling effort
